A.K.A. Mk8 place tracker V2

Huge Credit to @Glitcher01 for helping with the project.

This project is designed to track just about everything to do with a Mario Kart 8 DX Race Using a capture Card

So far only library needed is OpenCV and NumPy but I have plans to add an electron based interface and web apis
